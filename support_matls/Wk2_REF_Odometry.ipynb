    "## Building Python Nodes to Work with Odometry\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to import the `Odometry` message type from the `nav_msgs` package:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nav_msgs.msg import Odometry\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you set up your `rospy.Subscriber` you need to tell it the name of the topic that the odometry data is being published to, and you also need to then supply the `Odometry` message *type* that you have just imported, so that the `rospy.Subscriber` knows how to process the topic data.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "subscriber_object = rospy.Subscriber(\"[odometry topic]\", Odometry, callback_function)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In addition to this you also need to supply the name of a function that *should be defined earlier in your python code* and which *does something* with the message data.  In this case, we are referencing a function called `callback_function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `callback_function` is the function within which you will process your odometry data:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def callback_function(odom_data):\n",
    "```\n",
    "The function can take only **one input parameter**, in this case we are calling it `odom_data`.  This is where the `rospy.Subscriber` instance that we set up earlier will put the data that it obtains from the `\"[odometry topic]\"` whenever new topic data is published.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *If you are building this within a Python Class (like we did in the [subscriber example from Week 1](../past_weeks/COM2009_WK01/wk01_ROS_Concepts_1.ipynb#Exercise-5:-Creating-a-Subscriber-Node)), then don't forget to include a `self` parameter before the `odom_data` input.  This is an essential part of a [class instance method](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/#instance-methods), and the function itself still has only one real input parameter for the `rospy.Subscriber` instance to use:*\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class a_python_class:\n",
    "    def callback_function(self, odom_data):\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Obtaining the message data\n",
    "Within the callback function we then obtain the message data from the `odom_data` input parameter.  As an example, we can obtain the **linear position** of our robot in the **x axis** by walking through the nested structure of the message (as shown in the [figure above](#The-geometry_msgs/Odometry-message-illustrated)), separating the element names with `.`.  In this example, the `odom_data.pose.pose.position.x` portion of the message is assigned to the variable `linear_x`: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    linear_x = odom_data.pose.pose.position.x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *In your code, you will need to define the callback function **before** you define the `rospy.Subscriber` instance, otherwise you will get an error.  See the [week 1 subscriber example](../past_weeks/COM2009_WK01/wk01_ROS_Concepts_1.ipynb#Exercise-5:-Creating-a-Subscriber-Node) for guidance.*"
