    "This is the end of the Week 2 lab exercises.  Next week you will implement the motion controller package that you have built here on an actual robot, and also look at more advanced methods of robot navigation using the *ROS Navigation Stack* and *SLAM*.\n",

    "* In this session we have explored the odometry data that is published to the `/odom` topic by a robot\n",
    "    * This tells us where in physical space our robot is located and oriented, which can be used for *dead-reckoning navigation*\n",
    "    * The odometry data also contains *Twist* information, which tells us the current linear and angular velocities of our robot in terms of its 3 principal axes\n",
    "* We have also used the `/cmd_vel` topic to publish velocity commands to our robot to make it move \n",
    "* However, navigation based on odometry alone has it's limitatons which you might have already observed in Exercise 5.  You will find out more about this next week...\n",
